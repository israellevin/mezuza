Mezuza

A python script that uses openCV capture images of passers by, combined with a
CGI shell script that copies those pictures into a persistent directory and a
web application to dynamically load and count those pictures.

How to use:

0) Make sure you run all the commands from the mezuza directory

1) Run the python script:

    ./mezuza.py

2) Run the web server:

    python -m CGIHTTPServer

3) Open a browser and load http://[server's IP]:8000/mezuza.html

4) Profit.

The python script can receive up to 7 arguments:

1) ACTHIGH - number of inactive frames before accepting a new activation.
Default is 10

2) ACTLOW - number of active frames before accepting a new activation.
Default is 3
he n

3) PIXCOUNT - minimal amount of active pixels for an active frame.
Default is 10000

4) TH - minimal difference between two "different" pixels.
Default is 50

5) ADAPT - weight of new frame in adaptive base frame.
Default is 0.96

6) CAMERA - number of the camera to use.
Default is 0

7) DISPLAY - any value here means that the script will display graphics.
Assumes you are running something that can handle that (X forwarding?).
Default is false

Note: the python script copies the images to /shared and the shell script
copies them to mezuza/img where the web application expects to find them.
Both these directories are assumed to exist and be writable by the scripts.
